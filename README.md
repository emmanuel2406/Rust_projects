# RUST PROJECTS
A collection of Rust demos to walk through the overall functionality. \
**Most exercises follow the tutorials in https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book**
\
All projects were created using Rust's native *cargo* package manager.

The capstone project is in the folder `hello`. It follows the Chapter 20 tutorial to implement a multi-threaded web server with a thread pool from scratch.
